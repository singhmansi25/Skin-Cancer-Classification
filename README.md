# Skin-Cancer-Classification
The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that can classify a skin cancer into benign or malignant using images.

# Abstract
The most frequent type of cancer in the world is skin cancer. Early detection and diagnosis are 
vital for effective treatment. Deep learning has been found to be effective in the classification of 
skin cancer. In this report, we present a deep learning approach for classifying skin cancer. The 
algorithm was trained on approximately 10000 photos of skin cancer. In our method, we have used
convolutional neural network (CNN) for skin cancer classification. The CNN model is next trained 
on a collection of skin data tagged as benign or malignant. We validate our method using a 
publicly accessible database of skin images. For the training dataset, our method obtains a 90.7% 
accuracy. For the test set, the model achieves an accuracy of more than 89.9%. The model can 
accurately categorize both benign and malignant skin cancer. The model is a useful method for 
skin cancer early detection and treatment.

# â€¢ What is SKIN CANCER?
Skin cancer, which is the abnormal growth of skin cells, most occurs commonly on skin that has 
been exposed to sunlight. This usual type of cancer can also appear on parts of your skin that are not 
often exposed to sunlight.
Cancer develops when healthy cells mutate and expand uncontrollably, generating a mass known as 
a tumour. A tumour might be malignant or benign. Cancerous tumours are malignant, which means 
they can spread to other parts of the body. Although benign tumours might grow to be large, they 
will not infect neighbouring tissue or spread to different areas of your body. The boundaries of 
benign tumours are obvious, smooth, and regular, whereas malignant tumours have uneven borders 
and expand quickly than benign ones. There are two major types of skin cancer, which are stated 
below: Benign or Malignant.
